The YAML sets up links used in the Monthly periodic note. It basically turns sections of the weekly note into icons that I can hover over in a table in the monthly note to see the content without a lot of clicking back and forth.

As with all my periodic notes, the header gives me links to various levels of periodic notes and allows me to "scrub" through the level as well.

## Current Initiatives
pulls a section from this month's note that shows me what I've identified as the theme of the month.

## Last Week
Pulls in the Tasks and Days section from the previous weekly note. This lets me review it without needing to click back and forth. I'm a big fan of not clicking back and forth!

## GTD review
I've incorporated a lot of GTD methodology into my life. Here, I'm pushing a weekly review of active projects to ensure I have next actions defined, and if any other processing for them needs to occur. I'm also prone to running off on tangents that usually just distract me from the work I should be doing, so that second line is a weekly reminder. I made it a checkbox so that my brain gets a little 'win' if I didn't veer off unnecessarily. 

## This week
This is where I first identify the tasks which need to happen to move forward on the Initiatives listed above. These tasks, combine with 'next action' items in projects make up a bulk of the TODOs for my days.

## Needs attention
This is just one way I made sure that notes which may be abandoned, orphaned, or under-worked are not lost. It sometimes also surfaces really good notes, which just makes my day a little brighter because I can marvel at an awesome note, and see I don't need to do anything more to. That's a free 'check' for my brain!

## Log
Just as with my daily notes there is a log section that pulls from a habit-building/tracking note for weekly tasks that don't need to be tracked with the Tasks plugin.

## Days/Highlights
These two sections pull data from my daily notes for my weekly review process. I don't have to click back and forth between all the daily notes to get the overview them this way. Highlights are a tag that goes in front of a sentence and show up here. The thing has to be pretty special to get this tag.

## Reflection
The end of week admin stuff. I give a short summary of the day (required), and a 1-10 rating on several aspects of my experiences of the week (optional).

## Accomplishments
Did I get everything done today that I planned? Let's evaluate that. This and the next two sections are what get turned into the icons in the monthly note to hover over.

## What went good/bad
Self-explanatory, I think. In reviewing my week, identify at least one thing that went great, and one that went off the rails (it's a rare week that I can't add things to these sections, lol)

## Metadata
These are weekly tasks that I do track with the Tasks plugin so they show up in my daily notes and my 'Taskers' sidebar when they should.
