# Daily Periodic note
Snippets used: 
- the excellent MCL Multi-column snippets.

Plugins used:
- Templater
- Tasks
- Dataview

The YAML sets up links used in the Weekly periodic note. It basically turns sections of the daily note into icons that I can hover over in a table in the weekly note to see the content without a lot of clicking back and forth.

The float shows me prior year's notes for the same day, and the header provides me links to all the levels of periodic notes relevant to this specific day. I generate the links with Templater so that I don't have to wait until the specific day, week, month to create the note and have all the links generate correctly. As you can see, all journal notes are stored in an appropriate subfolder of the "Calendar" folder.

# Current Focus
pulls a section from this week's note that shows me what I've identified as the minimum I need to accomplish to consider this week a "win".

# Tasks due today
pretty self-explanatory. I'm so thankful the author of the Tasks plugin included "happens" since it will look a due and scheduled dates. This is super handy because sometimes something is due months from now, but I've scheduled to do it today. My query shows me tasks that are supposed to happen today and all overdue tasks. I use CSS to visually flag overdue tasks.

These are populated from all across my Obsidian. They are up for review every day so that my schedule can remain dynamic, and I can trust that I'm working on what I'm supposed to be at any given moment. I don't have perfect GTD adherence, and I'm okay with that.

## Task Inbox
this is where I add any tasks I identify throughout the day regardless of when they're due. The system surfaces them at the proper dates in my "Tasker" sidebar.

# Log
The log pulls in a habit tracker stored as another note. It's a basic checklist of personal things I want to accomplish each day, like reading or writing a little in the morning, taking my vitamin, and ensuring tomorrows tasks are scheduled on my Google calendar.

## Notes Created Today
Creates a handy way of seeing the output. It's a handy thing for me to have. My query excludes periodic notes themselves.

## Reflection
end of day admin, journaling stuff. I give a 1-10 rating (required), a short summary of the day (optional), and a fun anecdote or story of something I experienced that day (optional)

### Accomplishments
did I get everything done today that I planned? Let's evaluate that. This and the next two sections are what get turned into the icons in the weekly note to hover over.

### Journal
yep, the normal/standard journaling space where I write all the random stuff running through my head. I have a few inline tags that I use here that feed dataviews in other notes, like "MSL" (helps me keep track of plans and changes to my Obsidian) and "Empire" (track changes, plans, and a place to stream-think about my businesses).
