# Periodic Templates

I use these to manage most of my schedule, and to log habits and other journal-worthy information. These template files are how I keep my life (mostly) organized, they do that by filling/ sharing information up and down levels (Monthly <-> Weekly <-> Daily). This allows me see both detailed and wide-angle scopes of my life.

I tend to follow the mantra "as much as you need, as little as you need, be satisfied with enough" so I don't try to keep everything in my life within Obsidian. Having said that, I have ADHD, and using it as part of the system that keeps me alive and progressing towards my goals has helped me a lot. These templates require community plugins, usually Templater, Dataview, and Tasks, but sometimes some extra stuff. I've borrowed from other's templates, but can't possibly properly credit everyone. To anyone who recognizes your handy work, thank you!

## Daily
This is the main template of the entire application. It has a lot going on because I want to see a lot of info in one place rather than hunting it down via clicks. 

## Weekly
Contains so of the same, but also some different tracking info from the daily note. It's a great level to keep track of how I'm doing. Again, set up so that I don't have to click back and forth between a bunch of notes.
