#Periodic Templates

I use these to manage most of my schedule and to log habits and other journal-worthy information. These template files are how I keep my life (mostly) organized, they do that by filling sharing information up and down levels Monthly <-> Weekly <-> Daily. This allows me see both detailed and wide-angle scopes of my life.

I tend to follow the mantra "as much as you need, as little as you can, be satisfied with enough" so I don't try to keep everything in my life within Obsidian. Having said that, I have ADHD, and using it as part of the system that keeps me alive and progressing towards my goals has helped me a lot. These templates requires community plugins, usually just Templater, Dataview, Tasks, but sometimes some extra stuff. I've borrowed from other's templates, but can't possibly properly credit everyone. To anyone who recognizes you're handy work, thank you!

## Daily
This is the main template of the entire application. It has a lot going on because I want to see a lot of info in one place rather than hunting it down via clicks. This one does use the excellent MCL Multi-column snippets.

The YAML sets up links used in the Weekly periodic note. It basically turns sections of the daily note into icons that I can hover over in the weekly note to see the content without a lot of clicking back and forth.

The float shows me notes from years past for the same day, and the header provides me links to all the levels of notes relevant to this specific day. I generate the links with Templater so that I don't have to wait until the specific day, week, month to create the note and have all the links generate correctly. As you can see, all journal notes are stored in an appropriate subfolder of the "Calendar" folder.

#Current Focus - pulls a section from this week's note that shows me what I've identified as the minimum I need to accomplish to consider this week a "win".

#Tasks due today - pretty self-explanatory. I'm so thankful the author of the Tasks plugin included "happens" since it will look a due and scheduled dates. This is super handy because sometimes something is due months from now, but I've scheduled to do it today. My query shows me tasks that are supposed to happen today and all overdue tasks. I use CSS to visually flag overdue tasks.

## Other tasks - this is where I add any tasks I identify throughout the day regardless of when they're due. The system surfaces them at the proper dates in my "Tasker" sidebar.

# Log
The log pulls in a habit tracker stored as another note. It's a basic checklist of personal things I want to accomplish each day, like reading or writing a little in the morning, taking my vitamin, and ensuring tomorrows tasks are scheduled on my Google calendar.

## Notes I've created shows me any notes made on this day. It's a handy thing for me to have. My query excludes periodic notes.

## Reflection - end of day admin, journaling stuff. I give a 1-10 rating (required), a short summary of the day (optional), and a fun anecdote or story of something I experienced that day (optional)

### Accomplishments - did I get everything done today that I planned? Let's evaluate that. This and the next two sections are what get turned into the icons in the weekly note to hover over.

### Content log - I'm note sure if this section is providing me the value I thought it might. I read for entertainment at night, but for education/growth in the morning. I use Calibre to store/tracking my reading, and hold any annotations/notes I make. I'm note interested in those things existing in two places by importing all that library/book info into Obsidian. Calibre does a great job at what it does.

### Journal - yep, the normal/standard journaling space where I write all the random stuff running through my head. I have a few inline tags that I use here that feed dataviews in other notes, like "MSL" (helps me keep track of plans and changes to my Obsidian) and "Empire" (track changes, plans, and a place to stream-think about my businesses).
