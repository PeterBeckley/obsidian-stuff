# Other Pages
This is a collection of pages that serve information to me, but aren't template based.

## Book Shelf
I keep notes for each item in my collections. I have notes for books, with enough properties so that they're useful to me. This page allows me to see my book collection in several ways, including how many books are in my collection, what I've read so far this year, and what books I want to physically own, whether I've read it or not.
Case in point, I've read the kindle version of Atomic Habits by James Clear, but want a physical copy that I can keep handy, highlight, add margin notes, and generally personalize through my own thought process. Adding a #wanted tag to any item in any collection will display it on the relevant list. *This page uses plugins: Tabs by Huajin, and Dataview*
