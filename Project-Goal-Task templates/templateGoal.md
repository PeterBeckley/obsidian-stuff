GOAL: {{VALUE:Why this goal?}}
# Make it S.M.A.R.T
## What needs to be achieved? Be **S**pecific. Is it a physical deliverable, a performance increase/decrease, or a specific outcome?

## What does success look like? What metric will you use. "...as **M**easured by...". What are the key results? How do I tell when I've succeeded?

## Gut check. Can you **A**chieve it given your current situation? If not, what more/less do you need?

## Is it **R**elevant to my higher aspirations? (check my [[Statement of Principles]])

## In What **T**ime frame? You need a proper start and end date!

## Projects to make this happen
### Ideas
- 
### Created projects

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID file.link as "Project", status as "Status"
From #project AND (([[#]]) OR outgoing([[#]]))
WHERE file.name != this.file.name
SORT status desc
```
